# Hi, I'm James Le 👋🏼  👨🏽‍🎓 👨🏽‍💻 🇻🇳 🇺🇸

I'm a machine learning researcher who is deeply interested in tinkering with neural networks, building recommendation systems, and gathering best practices of machine learning in production.
I write often about theoretical deep learning and applied MLOps.

- 🔭 I’m doing research at the intersection of [`deep learning and recommendation systems`](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/transfer-rec).
- 🌱 I’m cracking the [`data science`](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/cracking-the-data-science-interview) and [`machine learning engineering`](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/technical-interview-prep) interviews.
- 👯 I’m looking to evangelize the [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/course-gitbook) community.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help to get more guests on [Datacast](https://datacast.simplecast.com/).
